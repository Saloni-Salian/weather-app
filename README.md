# Instructions for the Weather App

## Set-Up Guide
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)

**0. Before doing any of this, if you're using your own laptop/desktop, make sure you've got the latest versions of node and npm installed (npm v: 9.6.2 & node v: 18.0.0) :**

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation
**1. Clone this repository :**

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Juan-Alvarado/weatherapp-boilerplate.git weather-app
cd weather-app
```

**2. Make it your own :**

```sh
rm -rf .git && git init && npm init
```

> :information_source: Command above re-initializes the repo and sets up your NPM project.

**2a. Make it your own (Windows):**

If you are using Windowsyou can run the three necessary comand using Powershell. You mught need elevated privileges.

```sh
rm -r -fo .git
git init 
npm init
```
**3. Install the dependencies :**

Before the app can be run you will need to install the react icon library as well. This can be done using:

```sh
npm install
npm install react-icons
```

**4. Replace the src file with the one downloaded from the submission**


## Development Workflow

**1. Generate a production build in `./build` :**

```sh
npm run build
```

**2. Start local production server with [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve):**

```sh
npm start
```

> This simply serves up the contents of `./build`. Bear in mind, if you use this, the localhost port your server is running on will refresh, and you'll also need to restart it to see any changes you've made to the code in `src`.
